**App Idea: Disability-Friendly Maps**

I’d like to build Maps that specifically focuses on accessibility features for individuals with disabilities. The app would have features like:
- **Wheelchair Accessibility Filtering**: Users could filter routes and locations that are wheelchair accessible, including ramps, elevators, and door widths.
- **Accessible Bathrooms**: The app would highlight locations with wheelchair-accessible bathrooms and even provide real-time updates on their availability or maintenance status.
- **Audio Navigation with Visual Cues**: For users with vision impairments, I would integrate audio navigation, as well as provide visual cues for better understanding of surroundings. 

The goal would be to create a navigation tool that’s truly inclusive for people with different needs.
